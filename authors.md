## Credits

Thanks to [@timburgan](https://github.com/timburgan) for the initial idea. This project is heavily inspired on his. Also, big thanks to the authors and contributors of [python-chess](https://python-chess.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [PyGithub](https://pygithub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Without their libraries, this project would have been impossible :heart:

## Some extra information

All games are automatically archived into the `games/` folder in PGN format. The current game is always called games/current.pgn, and the archived games always follow the pattern `games/game-yyyymmdd-HHMMSS.pgn`. You can download the archived games and review them using an external application. Each move in the PGN file has a comment specifying who performed each move so you can see which moves you played!

Finally, if you find any problem, feel free to submit an issue or open a **PR** and I will be more than happy to take a look at it!
